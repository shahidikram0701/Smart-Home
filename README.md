# Smart-Home

The issue of security is very paramount in every household. Therefore we intend to provide a safe household to each and every one, making it using most basic sensors so as to make the availability to every facet of society be it rich or poor.
The need for a Smart Home in this age of energy crisis and where everything is automated, the need for a more secure house is evident. Taking this into consideration our project aims to build a model, which not only incorporates the most breached safety measures but also provides a novel way of intimidation to the inmates making it more practical to use.
The use of Keypad, PIR Motion Sensor, LEDâ€™s, LM35 Temperature sensor, Buzzer, Servo Motor, MQ2 Smoke and Gas Sensor are all used together along with few other electronic device and a dummy model for a demonstration are used.
